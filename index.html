         <h2>🎂HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELSHUYE🎂 💌😭</h2>
         <p>I dont even know where to start😌..Our bond meant the world to me, and the promises we made to each other were sacred.We shared laughter, tears, dreams and secrets. We go way back, don't we? From those highschool days 😅to growing up. Yk, u are the only person I've ever fought with and couldn't get over. And that's not something I ever expected, considering how stubborn I can be. But with u, it's different. u hv always had this hold on me. Even though life has taken us on different paths, u've always remained in my heart❣️❣️. I want u to know that I love you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ and I'm sorry🥺😭. Sorry for any pain I've caused, for the misunderstandings, for not being the kind of friend you deserved and for letting our friendship slip away. Losing you has been one of my biggest regrets, and I wish I could turn back time and make things right😫. u were the most caring and loving person in my life, I realize now that I was too blind to fully appreciate and understand your kindness.
         
         On your special day🥂🍰, I want to remind you of the incredible person you are. I'm forever grateful for the friendship we've built. Btw I am very proud of u. 
         
         ወድሻለው እናቴ with all my heart😊 and I really miss u!!! </p>
